The monthly rental for this order must be INR 500 or higher to qualify for the referral bonus.\n*   **For the Referrer:** Upon successful delivery of the friend's order, the referrer receives Rs 400 in RentoMoney.\n*   **RentoMoney Usage:** RentoMoney can be used for monthly rental payments (excluding security deposits) and can be combined with other offers and discounts. It is non-transferable and cannot be converted to cash.\n*   **Important Notes:**\n    *   Only registered users can use RentoMoney.\n    *   Referrers cannot use the code of someone they have referred.\n    *   If the friend cancels their subscription before delivery, the referral bonus is cancelled for both parties.\n    *   There is a maximum referral bonus cap for a referrer, which may vary.\n    *   Funds can only be added to the RentoMoney account through referral bonuses.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='instead of friend can i offer it to a relative?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), AIMessage(content='Yes, you can absolutely offer the referral to a relative!
