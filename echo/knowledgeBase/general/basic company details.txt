5 Reasons Why Renting Beats Buying
Is it smarter to buy instead of rent? Not when you’re renting from RentoMojo! We offer significant savings in addition to a multitude of extra benefits an ordinary store can’t offer.

Monthly savings: RentoMojo offers our products at a Rental Monthly Installment (RMI). This RMI is lower than the EMI you pay when you purchase the same product from a store.
Easy upgrades: At the end of the year, you can trade-in your rental product for a newer, different design! You won’t ever remain stuck with a product as long as you rent from us.
Free packing & moving: Not only do we deliver your product to you for free for the first time, but we’ll also pack and move it for you afterward if you move elsewhere. RentoMojo supports free relocation within as well as to all major Indian cities that we are present in.
Free maintenance: Any product is bound to wear down with time. But, that won’t happen if you rent from RentoMojo! We maintain your rental products for free periodically to keep them as good as new.
Love it or return it: If you purchase an item but find out you dislike it, you are stuck with it. You can’t give it back to the retailer. RentoMojo, however, allows you to return any item at the time of delivery. We won’t deduct your deposit.
