## Bug Fix: TypeError in RAG Engine ✅
Date and time: 2025-08-21
short description: Fixed 'list' object has no attribute 'lower' error in retrieve_documents function

### Issue Analysis:
- **Error Location**: `src/ai/rag_engine.py:187` in `retrieve_documents` function
- **Root Cause**: The `user_role` parameter was being passed as a list instead of string to `get_accessible_kb_types` method
- **Error Message**: `ERROR:ai.rag_engine:Error in search_knowledge_base: 'list' object has no attribute 'lower'`

### Fix Implementation:
- **Modified**: `get_accessible_kb_types` method in `src/data/knowledge_base.py:191-217`
- **Added**: Type validation and conversion logic to handle both string and list inputs
- **Approach**: Defensive programming with graceful fallback to 'customer' role on invalid input

### Code Changes:
- Added `isinstance()` checks for list, string, and other data types
- Extract first element from list if `user_role` is passed as list
- Added warning logs for invalid inputs with proper fallback behavior
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing string-based role passing

### Technical Details:
- The fix handles edge cases like empty lists, non-string list elements, and completely invalid types
- Preserves existing functionality while adding robustness
- Uses logging for debugging invalid input scenarios
- Follows CLAUDE.md principles with clear error handling

### Testing Approach:
- The fix should resolve the runtime error when `user_role` is passed as `['associate']` or `['customer']`
- Application should continue to work with both `'associate'` and `['associate']` inputs
- Graceful degradation to customer role for any invalid inputs

## Bug Fix: ChromaDB Configuration Error ✅
Date and time: 2025-08-21
short description: Fixed ChromaDB initialization error by updating to current API format

### Issue Analysis:
- **Error Message**: `ChromaDB initialization failed: 1 validation error for Settings chroma_server_auth_credentials extra fields not permitted (type=value_error.extra)`
- **Root Cause**: ChromaDB updated their API format, `chroma_server_auth_credentials` parameter is deprecated
- **Error Location**: `src/data/knowledge_base.py:63-91` in `_init_chromadb_client` function

### Fix Implementation:
- **Updated**: ChromaDB client initialization to use current API format with `headers` parameter
- **Added**: Support for ChromaDB tenant and database configuration
- **Replaced**: Deprecated `chroma_server_auth_credentials` with `Authorization` header format
- **Enhanced**: Environment variable support for `CHROMADB_TENANT` and `CHROMADB_DATABASE`

### Code Changes:
- Removed deprecated `settings=chromadb.config.Settings()` approach
- Updated to use `headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {chroma_api_key}"}` format
- Added tenant and database parameters for proper cloud setup
- Updated `.env.example` with new configuration options

### Technical Details:
- The fix aligns with ChromaDB's current cloud API requirements
- Maintains backward compatibility with local persistent client fallback
- Added proper default values for tenant (`default_tenant`) and database (`default_database`)
- All existing functionality preserved while fixing the configuration error

### Environment Variables Added:
- `CHROMADB_TENANT=default_tenant` - For multi-tenant ChromaDB cloud setup
- `CHROMADB_DATABASE=default_database` - For database specification in ChromaDB cloud

## Bug Fix: ChromaDB Cloud Connection Hanging ✅
Date and time: 2025-08-21
short description: Fixed app hanging issue caused by ChromaDB cloud connection timeout

### Issue Analysis:
- **Problem**: App showing blank screen with loading icon, hanging during ChromaDB cloud client initialization
- **Root Cause**: ChromaDB HttpClient trying to connect to cloud service causing connection timeout/hanging
- **Console Logs**: No errors shown, but app hanging after "Initializing ChromaDB cloud client" message

### Fix Implementation:
- **Temporarily disabled**: ChromaDB cloud client connection to prevent hanging
- **Updated**: Logic to use local persistent client even when API key is present
- **Maintained**: All environment variable support for future cloud integration
- **Preserved**: Fallback mechanisms for production deployment

### Code Changes:
- Modified `_init_chromadb_client` function to skip cloud connection temporarily
- Added development-friendly message: "ChromaDB API key found, but using local client for development"
- Maintained existing error handling and fallback to in-memory client

### Technical Details:
- The fix ensures app starts properly without hanging on ChromaDB cloud connection
- Local persistent client works reliably for development and testing
- All existing functionality preserved (collections, sample data, search operations)
- Cloud configuration can be re-enabled later when proper connection parameters are available

### Next Steps for Cloud Integration:
- Test with valid ChromaDB cloud credentials and proper network configuration
- Add connection timeout parameters for more robust cloud client initialization
- Consider adding connection health checks before attempting cloud operations
