short description: Implemented Phase 1.1 and 1.2 - Project Structure Setup and Basic Authentication & Role Management

### Phase 1.1 - Project Structure Setup ✅
- Created modular Python project structure with organized directories:
  - `src/auth/` - Authentication and role management

  - `src/data/` - Data persistence layer (ready for implementation)
  - `src/integrations/` - External integrations (Jira, ticket manager)
  - `src/ui/` - Streamlit user interface
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions

- Initialized core modules:
  - `intent_classifier.py` - Basic keyword-based intent classification with sentiment analysis

  - `ticket_manager.py` - Ticket creation and tracking system
  - `auth_handler.py` (role_manager.py & session_handler.py) - Role-based authentication

- Configured environment and dependencies:
  - `requirements.txt` with all necessary dependencies (Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, Gemini)
  - `.env.example` with environment variable templates
  - Main application entry point `app.py`

### Phase 1.2 - Basic Authentication & Role Management ✅
- Implemented role selection in Streamlit sidebar:
  - Associate and Customer role options
  - Role persistence in session state

- Basic session state management:
  - Session handler for managing user context
  - Chat history persistence
  - Role-based state management

- Access control for knowledge bases:

  - Role-based knowledge base filtering in RAG engine

### Technical Implementation Details:
- Used enum-based role system for type safety

- Session persistence across page interactions

### Phase 1.3 - Intent Classification System ✅
- Enhanced intent classifier with ML-based classification using sentence transformers:

  - Created comprehensive training dataset with 50+ labeled examples across all intents
  - Implemented hybrid approach: ML-based intent classification + keyword-based urgency/sentiment
  - Added confidence scoring and accuracy testing framework
  - Graceful fallback to keyword-based classification when ML model fails to load

- Test validation system:
  - Created `test_dataset.py` with 50+ categorized test cases covering edge cases
  - Built `test_intent_classifier.py` script for automated accuracy testing
  - Target >80% accuracy validation (as specified in implementation plan)
  - Comprehensive test coverage for intent, urgency, and sentiment classification

### Phase 1.4 - Data Persistence Layer ✅
- Implemented SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM:
  - `ChatSession` model for conversation contexts with role-based tracking
  - `UserInteraction` model for storing messages with intent analysis results
  - `Ticket` model for complaint/service request tracking with status management
  - Full CRUD operations with proper error handling and transaction management

- Database features:
  - Automatic table creation and schema management
  - Session-based chat history persistence
  - Intent analysis storage for conversation insights
  - Ticket lifecycle management with status tracking
  - Database statistics and health monitoring
  - Proper relationship mapping between sessions, interactions, and tickets

### Phase 1.3 & 1.4 Integration - Gemini API Client ✅
- Fully integrated Google Gemini 1.5 Flash API:
  - Proper API key configuration with environment variable handling
  - Safety settings configured to block harmful content
  - RAG-based response generation with context from knowledge bases
  - Chat history context integration for conversational continuity
  - Conversation summarization capabilities
  - Graceful error handling with user-friendly fallback messages

- Enhanced RAG Engine:
  - Updated to use Gemini for actual response generation (no longer placeholder)
  - Context-aware document retrieval with knowledge base filtering
  - Chat history integration for maintaining conversation context
  - Improved error handling and logging
  - Knowledge base source attribution in responses

### Technical Implementation Details:
- ML models load automatically on startup with fallback mechanisms
- Database operations are transaction-safe with proper session management
- Gemini API calls include rate limiting awareness and error recovery
- All components follow CLAUDE.md principles with proper error handling
- Comprehensive logging throughout all new components for debugging and monitoring

### Next Steps:
- Proceed to Phase 2: RAG & Knowledge Management (ChromaDB integration) ✅
- Implement Phase 3: Tool Integration (Jira ticket creation)
- Set up actual knowledge base content and vector storage ✅  
- Add Phase 4: UI enhancements and error handling improvements
