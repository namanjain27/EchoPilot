# EchoPilot Tech Stack Analysis & Suggestions

## Minimal Additions for Prototype Validation

### 1. Simple Authentication
```
Current: No auth system
Prototype suggestion: Simple password/role selection in Streamlit sidebar
Benefits:
- Test Associate vs Customer mode switching
- Validate different access levels
- Keep it simple with st.selectbox for role selection
```

### 2. Essential Missing Components

#### Basic Data Persistence
- **Current gap**: No chat history storage
- **Prototype solution**: Simple JSON file storage or SQLite
- **Schema**: Basic chat sessions and ticket data
- **Why**: Test conversation context and ticket creation flow

#### Session Management
- **Addition**: Streamlit session state for conversation memory
- **Benefits**: Test multi-turn conversations and context awareness

### 3. Core AI Features to Test

#### Intent Classification Testing
```
Current: Simple query/complaint/service request
Prototype focus: 
- Test accuracy of 3 main categories
- Add basic urgency detection (High/Medium/Low)
- Simple sentiment analysis (Positive/Negative/Neutral)
- Validate with sample conversations
```

#### RAG Pipeline Validation
```
Focus areas for testing:
- Knowledge base retrieval accuracy
- Context window management
- Response quality with different query types
- Tool calling for Jira integration
```

## Prototype-Focused Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Core Functionality Validation (2-3 weeks)
```
✅ Keep current tech stack:
- Streamlit frontend
- Gemini 2.5 Flash
- ChromaDB cloud
- LangChain for orchestration

➕ Minimal additions:
- SQLite for basic persistence
- Streamlit session state
- Simple role selection
- Basic logging for testing
```

### Success Criteria for Prototype
```
Core features working:
✓ Text + image input processing
✓ Intent classification (query/complaint/service)
✓ RAG-based responses from knowledge base
✓ Jira ticket creation for complaints
✓ Associate vs Customer mode differentiation
✓ Conversation context maintenance
✓ Basic ticket ID generation and tracking
```

### What NOT to Build (For Prototype)
```
❌ Complex authentication systems
❌ Real-time features
❌ Advanced analytics
❌ Multi-language support
❌ Voice capabilities
❌ Advanced UI/UX
❌ Scalability optimizations
❌ Production monitoring
```

## Testing & Validation Focus

### 1. Core Use Case Validation
- **Intent accuracy**: Test with 50+ sample queries across categories
- **Response quality**: Validate answers against knowledge base
- **Ticket creation**: Test Jira integration with different complaint types
- **Mode switching**: Validate Associate vs Customer access differences

### 2. Simple Prototype Enhancements (If Time Permits)
- **Basic conversation memory** using Streamlit session state
- **Simple logging** to track interactions for analysis
- **Basic error handling** for API failures
- **Conversation export** feature for later analysis

### 3. Key Metrics to Track During Testing
```
Performance metrics:
- Response time (target: <5 seconds)
- Intent classification accuracy (target: >80%)
- Knowledge retrieval relevance (manual evaluation)
- Successful ticket creation rate
```
