# Goal
we need to do code changes to ensure:
1. correct docs are pulled out from the RAG KB -> scoring
2. if the question is big and vague then we need to do query transformation to break the user query into multiple questions that go from general to advanced. This ensures that all necessary information is extracted from RAG and feed into LLM for final answer. -> new initial llm node
3. final answer satisfies the user needs from the query -> reviewer agent
4. feedback for each answer

# Solutions & Implementation Analysis

## 1. Enhanced RAG Document Retrieval with Scoring

### Problem Analysis
Current retrieval might not be selecting the most relevant documents due to lack of proper scoring mechanisms.

### Solution
Implement a hybrid scoring system combining:
- **Semantic similarity scores** (existing vector search)
- **Keyword matching scores** (BM25 or TF-IDF)
- **Document quality scores** (metadata-based ranking)
- **Recency scores**

### Implementation Process
1. **Create scoring module** (`rag_scoring.py`)
   - Implement multiple scoring algorithms
   - Create weighted combination function
   - Add configurable score weights

2. **Modify retrieval pipeline**
   - Update `data_ingestion.py` to include scoring
   - Modify query processing in `services.py`
   - Add score threshold filtering

3. **Add evaluation metrics**
   - Implement relevance scoring
   - Create retrieval quality metrics
   - Add logging for score analysis

## 2. Query Transformation and Decomposition

### Problem Analysis
Large, vague queries often miss important context because single embeddings can't capture all aspects.

### Solution
Implement a query decomposition system:
- **Query analysis LLM node** to assess complexity/vagueness
- **Query decomposition** into sub-questions (general â†’ specific)
- **Multi-stage retrieval** for each sub-question
- **Context aggregation** before final answer generation

### Implementation Process
1. **Create query analyzer** (`query_transformer.py`)
   - LLM-based complexity detection
   - Query decomposition logic
   - Sub-question generation with priority ordering

2. **Implement multi-stage retrieval**
   - Sequential processing of sub-questions
   - Context accumulation strategy
   - Deduplication of retrieved documents

3. **Update chat pipeline**
   - Modify `chat.py` route to handle decomposition
   - Update `services.py` for multi-stage processing
   - Add session management for sub-queries

## 3. Answer Quality Review Agent

### Problem Analysis
No mechanism to validate if the generated answer actually addresses the user's query comprehensively.

### Solution
Implement a reviewer agent that:
- **Evaluates answer completeness** against original query
- **Checks factual consistency** with retrieved documents
- **Assesses answer quality** (clarity, structure, relevance)
- **Triggers re-generation** if quality is below threshold

### Implementation Process
1. **Create reviewer module** (`answer_reviewer.py`)
   - LLM-based answer evaluation
   - Quality scoring rubric
   - Improvement suggestion generation

2. **Implement feedback loop**
   - Answer quality assessment
   - Automatic retry mechanism
   - Quality threshold configuration

3. **Integration with chat flow**
   - Add review step before response
   - Implement retry logic
   - Add quality metrics logging

## 4. User Feedback System

### Problem Analysis
No mechanism to capture and learn from user satisfaction with answers.

### Solution
Implement comprehensive feedback system:
- **Immediate feedback** (thumbs up/down, rating)
- **Detailed feedback** (what was missing, what was good)
- **Feedback storage** and analysis
- **Continuous improvement** based on feedback patterns

### Implementation Process
1. **Create feedback models** (update `models/responses.py`)
   - Feedback data structures
   - Rating systems
   - Comment storage

2. **Implement feedback endpoints** (`routes/feedback.py`)
   - Feedback submission API
   - Feedback retrieval for analysis
   - Feedback aggregation endpoints

3. **Update UI components** (`echo_ui.py`)
   - Add feedback buttons/forms
   - Display feedback options
   - Show feedback history

## Overall Architecture Changes

### New Components Needed
1. `rag_scoring.py` - Enhanced retrieval scoring
2. `query_transformer.py` - Query analysis and decomposition
3. `answer_reviewer.py` - Answer quality assessment
4. `routes/feedback.py` - Feedback management APIs
5. `models/feedback.py` - Feedback data models

### Modified Components
1. `services.py` - Updated chat pipeline with new stages
2. `routes/chat.py` - Enhanced chat API with review cycle
3. `data_ingestion.py` - Improved retrieval with scoring
4. `echo_ui.py` - Feedback UI components
5. `models/responses.py` - Extended response models

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: RAG scoring enhancement (immediate retrieval improvement)
2. **Phase 2**: Query transformation (handle complex queries)
3. **Phase 3**: Answer reviewer (quality assurance)
4. **Phase 4**: Feedback system (continuous improvement)

### Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Multi-stage processing will increase response time
- **Cost**: Additional LLM calls for analysis/review
- **Complexity**: More components to maintain and debug
- **Configuration**: Need extensive parameter tuning for optimal results

### Success Metrics
- **Retrieval accuracy**: Improved document relevance scores
- **Answer quality**: Higher user satisfaction ratings
- **Query handling**: Better responses to complex/vague questions
- **User engagement**: Increased feedback participation and positive ratings
