# format: add time and very small description to what are the code changes made for

## Bug Fix - Streamlit File Uploader Labels (Aug 31, 2025)
- Fixed TypeError in app.py by adding required 'label' parameter to all st.file_uploader() calls
- Updated file uploaders in chat section (images and documents) and data ingestion section
- Application now runs without the missing positional argument error

## SentenceTransformer ChromaDB Integration Fix
- Created wrapper class `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` to make SentenceTransformer compatible with ChromaDB
- Added required `embed_documents` and `embed_query` methods that ChromaDB expects
- Fixed the embedding model initialization to work with the smaller, faster SentenceTransformer model

## Chat History Token Optimization
- Fixed chat history token optimization by cleaning metadata before LLM calls
- Chat history now sends only content field, removing unnecessary response_metadata, usage_metadata, and additional_kwargs
- This reduces token usage significantly for context preservation

## Chat History Persistence
- Added chat history save/load functionality using JSON format in chat_history.txt file
- Chat history is now automatically loaded on app startup and saved on exit (quit/exit commands)
- Supports both HumanMessage and AIMessage types for complete conversation persistence
- Fixed AIMessage content extraction bug in should_continue function by accessing result.content instead of passing entire result object

## Data Ingestion Updates
- Modified `ingest_file_to_vectordb()` to accept multiple file paths (string or list)
- Added error handling to skip unsupported/missing files and continue processing others
- Updated main section to handle comma-separated file inputs for batch processing

## Multi-Modal Image Support Implementation
- Added direct image processing capabilities using existing Gemini-2.5-flash model
- Implemented `process_image_to_base64()` helper function supporting PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP formats
- Created `parse_multimodal_input()` to extract image references from user input using 'image:' or 'img:' syntax
- Enhanced `running_agent()` to handle multi-modal HumanMessage content arrays with text and base64-encoded images
- Updated system prompt to include image analysis capabilities and decision flow for visual content
- No library changes required - leverages existing ChatGoogleGenerativeAI multi-modal support

## Comprehensive Multi-File Support Extension
- Extended multi-modal capabilities to support documents: PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX alongside existing image support
- Added `process_document_to_text()` function leveraging existing data_ingestion processors for real-time text extraction
- Enhanced `parse_multimodal_input()` to handle both images and documents with extended syntax: pdf:, txt:, md:, doc:
- Updated `running_agent()` for hybrid message construction combining document text content with image base64 encoding
- Supports complex queries like "Compare report pdf:/quarterly.pdf with chart image:/sales.png and notes txt:/meeting.txt"
- Real-time document processing eliminates vector store delays while maintaining full context analysis capability

## Chat Session Summarization System
- Implemented automatic chat session summarization with timestamp tracking using datetime module
- Fixed `summarize_current_chat()` function to properly summarize conversations and grade resolution quality (A/B/C)
- Added `load_chat_summary()` and `save_chat_summary()` functions in chat_mgmt.py for persistent summary storage
- Replaced detailed chat history loading with summary-based context to optimize token usage and maintain conversation continuity

## Chat Context and Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced messages_with_context to include current_chat_messages for proper ongoing conversation context
- Added robust error handling for Gemini empty responses in summarization process with fallback mechanisms
- Implemented try-catch blocks to prevent crashes when Gemini returns empty content during chat summarization

## Streamlit UI Implementation Plan Creation
- Created comprehensive UI implementation plan in plans/UI.md with detailed architecture design
- Designed two-section layout: data ingestion interface and interactive chat section with multi-modal support
- Defined complete file structure, dependencies, integration points, and step-by-step implementation approach for clean Streamlit interface
- Added phase-wise implementation plan with 3 phases focusing on minimal viable UI first, then progressive enhancement

## Phase 1 Streamlit UI Implementation Complete
- Created echo_ui.py backend wrapper with initialize_agent(), process_user_message(), and get_vector_store_status() functions
- Added ingest_file_with_feedback() function to data_ingestion.py for UI-friendly status reporting with success/failure messages
- Implemented complete app.py with tabbed interface featuring chat and data ingestion sections, session state management, and file upload functionality

## Phase 2 Streamlit UI Enhancement Complete
- Enhanced echo_ui.py process_user_message() to support multi-modal input with image_files and doc_files parameters
- Implemented comprehensive multi-modal chat interface with image and document upload support in columns layout
- Added multiple file upload capability for data ingestion with real-time progress bars and batch processing
- Enhanced knowledge base status display with metrics and refresh functionality, plus improved processing history with numbered entries

## Phase 3 Professional UI & Advanced Features Complete
- Implemented proper form-based input system that resets text box and file uploads after sending queries using dynamic keys
- Replaced Clear Chat with End Chat Session functionality that creates chat summaries and gracefully ends sessions like echo.py
- Added comprehensive chat persistence across sessions with automatic save/load using persistent_chat.json storage
- Created professional export functionality supporting both JSON and text formats with timestamp and attachment metadata
- Enhanced chat interface with better positioning, avatars, message formatting, and organized layout with management buttons
- Added help section with tips, session management controls, and comprehensive user guidance for all features

## Chat Interface Redesign & Unified File Processing (Aug 31, 2025)  
- Redesigned chat interface with minimal text input box and inline send button for cleaner user experience
- Moved chat utility buttons (Export, New Chat, End Session) to the end of the chat section for better workflow
- Created single unified file upload box supporting all file types: images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WEBP) and documents (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX)
- Implemented process_uploaded_files() function in multiModalInputService.py for automatic file categorization based on extension
- Streamlined file processing logic to eliminate separate image/document upload widgets in favor of single unified approach

## Chat Interface Enhancement & UX Improvements (Aug 31, 2025)
- Fixed empty label accessibility warning by replacing st.text_area("") with st.chat_input() 
- Removed form wrapper around chat input for cleaner interface without boundaries
- Implemented immediate user message display - user messages appear instantly before AI processing begins
- Restructured layout with single row containing file upload and all utility buttons (Export, New Chat, End Session)
- Eliminated input_key session state management as it's no longer needed without forms
- Improved user experience with native chat input widget and responsive message flow
