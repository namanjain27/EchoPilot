## SentenceTransformer ChromaDB Integration Fix
- Created wrapper class `SentenceTransformerEmbeddings` to make SentenceTransformer compatible with ChromaDB
- Added required `embed_documents` and `embed_query` methods that ChromaDB expects
- Fixed the embedding model initialization to work with the smaller, faster SentenceTransformer model

## Chat History Token Optimization
- Fixed chat history token optimization by cleaning metadata before LLM calls
- Chat history now sends only content field, removing unnecessary response_metadata, usage_metadata, and additional_kwargs
- This reduces token usage significantly for context preservation

## Chat History Persistence
- Added chat history save/load functionality using JSON format in chat_history.txt file
- Chat history is now automatically loaded on app startup and saved on exit (quit/exit commands)
- Supports both HumanMessage and AIMessage types for complete conversation persistence
- Fixed AIMessage content extraction bug in should_continue function by accessing result.content instead of passing entire result object

## Data Ingestion Updates
- Modified `ingest_file_to_vectordb()` to accept multiple file paths (string or list)
- Added error handling to skip unsupported/missing files and continue processing others
- Updated main section to handle comma-separated file inputs for batch processing

## Multi-Modal Image Support Implementation
- Added direct image processing capabilities using existing Gemini-2.5-flash model
- Implemented `process_image_to_base64()` helper function supporting PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP formats
- Created `parse_multimodal_input()` to extract image references from user input using 'image:' or 'img:' syntax
- Enhanced `running_agent()` to handle multi-modal HumanMessage content arrays with text and base64-encoded images
- Updated system prompt to include image analysis capabilities and decision flow for visual content
- No library changes required - leverages existing ChatGoogleGenerativeAI multi-modal support

## Comprehensive Multi-File Support Extension
- Extended multi-modal capabilities to support documents: PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX alongside existing image support
- Added `process_document_to_text()` function leveraging existing data_ingestion processors for real-time text extraction
- Enhanced `parse_multimodal_input()` to handle both images and documents with extended syntax: pdf:, txt:, md:, doc:
- Updated `running_agent()` for hybrid message construction combining document text content with image base64 encoding
- Supports complex queries like "Compare report pdf:/quarterly.pdf with chart image:/sales.png and notes txt:/meeting.txt"
- Real-time document processing eliminates vector store delays while maintaining full context analysis capability

## Chat Session Summarization System
- Implemented automatic chat session summarization with timestamp tracking using datetime module
- Fixed `summarize_current_chat()` function to properly summarize conversations and grade resolution quality (A/B/C)
- Added `load_chat_summary()` and `save_chat_summary()` functions in chat_mgmt.py for persistent summary storage
- Replaced detailed chat history loading with summary-based context to optimize token usage and maintain conversation continuity

## Chat Context and Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced messages_with_context to include current_chat_messages for proper ongoing conversation context
- Added robust error handling for Gemini empty responses in summarization process with fallback mechanisms
- Implemented try-catch blocks to prevent crashes when Gemini returns empty content during chat summarization

## Streamlit UI Implementation Plan Creation
- Created comprehensive UI implementation plan in plans/UI.md with detailed architecture design
- Designed two-section layout: data ingestion interface and interactive chat section with multi-modal support
- Defined complete file structure, dependencies, integration points, and step-by-step implementation approach for clean Streamlit interface
- Added phase-wise implementation plan with 3 phases focusing on minimal viable UI first, then progressive enhancement

## Phase 1 Streamlit UI Implementation Complete
- Created echo_ui.py backend wrapper with initialize_agent(), process_user_message(), and get_vector_store_status() functions
- Added ingest_file_with_feedback() function to data_ingestion.py for UI-friendly status reporting with success/failure messages
- Implemented complete app.py with tabbed interface featuring chat and data ingestion sections, session state management, and file upload functionality

## UI Enhancement Implementation Plan Created
- Analyzed current Streamlit UI implementation in app.py and echo_ui.py components
- Created detailed 3-phase implementation plan in plans/UI.md covering multi-modal file upload, enhanced chat session management, and UI/UX improvements
- Plan includes technical considerations for integrating with existing multiModalInputService.py functions

## Phase 1: Multi-modal File Upload in Chat Interface - Complete
- Added file uploader widget in chat tab supporting images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP) and documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
- Integrated with existing multiModalInputService.py functions using process_uploaded_files() for file processing
- Updated message processing pipeline in echo_ui.py to handle combined text + image + document inputs for multi-modal LLM processing
- Fixed Streamlit file uploader state modification error by using dynamic widget keys that increment after message processing

## Phase 2: Enhanced Chat Session Management - Complete
- Replaced "Clear Chat" button with "End Chat" button in app.py with proper chat session ending workflow
- Integrated save_current_chat_session() function call that triggers chat summarization before clearing chat history

## Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements - Complete  
- Added auto-clear functionality for file context in data ingestion tab after successful file processing
- Implemented "Clear Processing History" button in Data Ingestion tab to allow users to clear processing status display
- Enhanced data ingestion workflow with proper file uploader state management using dynamic keys
- Added confirmation/success messages and error handling for chat session saving process

## UI Width and Backend Flow Optimization
- Reduced file uploader widget width using column layout (2:1 ratio) to prevent full-page width in both chat and data ingestion tabs
- Fixed duplicate chat summary loading issue by separating frontend (echo_ui.py) and backend (echo.py) chat flows
- Made "End Chat" button work automatically without requiring backend 'exit' input by implementing local summarization logic in echo_ui.py

## Streamlit Cloud Deployment SQLite3 Fix - Enhanced
- Created dedicated sqlite_fix.py module to handle SQLite3 compatibility before any ChromaDB imports
- Fixed corrupted requirements.txt encoding issues and moved pysqlite3-binary==0.5.2 to top priority
- Applied SQLite3 override in both app.py and services.py entry points to ensure early module substitution before ChromaDB initialization

## Data Ingestion UI File Name Display Fix
- Fixed processing history in data ingestion tab showing temp file names instead of actual uploaded file names
- Modified ingest_file_with_feedback() to accept optional original_file_name parameter and use it for display purposes
- Updated app.py file processing to pass uploaded_file.name as the original file name to maintain proper file identification in UI

## JIRA Tool Parameter Alignment Fix
- Fixed parameter mismatch between create_jira_ticket() in echo.py and create_ticket() in jira_tool.py
- Changed JiraTool method signature from (desc, ticket_type) to (description, intent) to match the tool definition
- Added better error handling and debugging in take_action() function to show actual tool arguments and catch exceptions

## Architecture Refactoring - Centralized Agent Logic
- Refactored echo.py to extract reusable get_tools() and create_agent() functions for consistent tool definitions across CLI and UI
- Completely rewrote echo_ui.py to eliminate duplicate tool definitions and import centralized agent creation from echo.py
- Removed duplicate create_jira_ticket and retriever_tool definitions from echo_ui.py that caused parameter mismatches
- Now both CLI and UI use exactly the same JIRA tool with proper 5-parameter structure (summary, description, intent, urgency, sentiment)
- Maintained backward compatibility for CLI usage while ensuring UI uses centralized logic
